    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure people realize what a boon the Apple Watch&amp;#39;s oximeter (blood oxygen app) may be to
one&amp;#39;s tracking of personal health, so I thought I&amp;#39;d provide some example data to provide a feel for
what you&amp;#39;ll be able to monitor. Of course, a lot will depend on what people discover about the
watch&amp;#39;s oxygen monitoring: Accuracy, the granularity of data, etc. But I think it&amp;#39;s going to be
a great help for people who want to understand better the relationship between blood oxygen levels
and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR on this is that with oximeter readings and metrics for heart rate variability, you can
get some insights into possible sleep apnea that can increase heart rate variability and potentially
cause atrial fibrillation (which can in turn provoke stroke or heart failure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All graphs and charts are shared with the permission of the person who originated the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first image shows the overnight blood oxygen this person has on a typical night using a CPAP
machine. This looks good. All SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) values are above 90%. The person&amp;#39;s
pulse is low. &lt;a href="(https://www.webmd.com/lung/pulse-oximetry-test)"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; says: &amp;quot;A blood oxygen level
lower than 89% means you may not have enough oxygen in your blood to meet your body&amp;#39;s needs. This
could be because there’s a problem with your heart or lungs.&amp;quot; These values were collected with a
&lt;a href="https://getwellue.com/pages/o2ring-oxygen-monitor"&gt;Wellue O2Ring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../assets/images/pulseox1-6d1be445.jpg" title="Normal pulse ox readings" alt="pulseox1" width="750" height="1334" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, one way you might be starving your brain and body for oxygen is if you have sleep apnea.
This person uses a CPAP device every night, but recently when traveling did not have the CPAP.
Here&amp;#39;s what can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../assets/images/pulseox2-d625e53c.jpg" title="pulse ox readings slowing sleep apnea" alt="pulseox2" width="750" height="1334" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the second image, during sleep apnea, one&amp;#39;s blood oxygen level can spike way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prolonged episodes of sleep apnea can cause a lot of problems. The
&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;
says: &amp;quot;Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during sleep apnea increase blood pressure and
strain the cardiovascular system. Having obstructive sleep apnea increases your risk of high blood
pressure (hypertension). Obstructive sleep apnea might also increase your risk of recurrent heart
attack, stroke and abnormal heartbeats, such as atrial fibrillation. If you have heart disease,
multiple episodes of low blood oxygen (hypoxia or hypoxemia) can lead to sudden death from an
irregular heartbeat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a doctor, but there are articles
(&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306298/"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;) suggesting that prolonged sleep
apnea with its impact on blood oxygen can affect heart rate variability (HRV), which would seem to
be a leading indicator for issues such as atrial fibrillation (afib) which is a form of cardiac
arrhythmia that can lead to a stroke or heart failure. The Apple Watch can track this. Here are
three examples of HRV readings from the Apple Health app. The first one shows relatively normal HRV
for this person; the second shows elevate readings; and then the third image shows HRV leading up to
the onset of afib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this person started using a CPAP, the HRV settled down, and the heart reverted from afib to
normal &amp;quot;sinus&amp;quot; rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, had this person known his or her oxygen levels, there might have been an earlier
conversation with a physician leading to some controls (such as better diet, reduced caffiene and
alcohol consumption, more exercise, the use of a CPAP machine . . .) that might have reduced the
likelihood of afib occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why does that software contractor cost so much?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[I was listening to &lt;a href="https://www.bikeshed.fm/254"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; that was talking a bit about
billing, and it inspired me to go back to this post I drafted in March of 2008. It still seems about
right, so here it is. Bonus: A bit about invoicing.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The hourly rate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend (a small business owner) recently who felt that $200/hour is too much to
pay for a software or design contractor. That is indeed not a small hourly rate. But where does that
number come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how it works. Software developers and graphic designs are people just like you, with rent or
 mortgages, possibly a family, and a limited number of hours in the day to get anything done. Let&amp;#39;s
 say for the sake of argument that a young contractor wants to make on average $125,000 / year (in a
 lean year, perhaps that would be $85,000 and in a flush year it would be $150,000). This contractor
 thinks she has 2,000 billable hours per year. That&amp;#39;s really quite a lot of billable hours. It&amp;#39;s
 assuming one bills out eight hours a day, every work day, every week, except for two weeks of
 vacation. I.e., 8 hours * 5 days * 50 weeks = 2,000 total hours. Yes, the contractor might
 occasionally work 14 hours, or on weekends, but you get the idea. Personally I think overwork is a
 recipe for disaster (because overwork impinges on quality and results in billing weak hours, i.e.,
 hours made inefficient due to sleeplessness and inefficiency), and furthermore that the contractor
 should be including time off of at least four weeks off over the year, to recharge, remember one&amp;#39;s
 family, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at first it would seem that if you divided $125,000 by 2,000 hours, you&amp;#39;d get an hourly rate of
 $62.50. But that&amp;#39;s not the way it works, because the contractor is also engaging in business
 development, i.e., finding new customers. Business development can take a full 50% of one&amp;#39;s time.
 You will have to trust me on this, but it&amp;#39;s true. There is also a lot of lost business because you
 are in an existing contract and have no extra bandwidth. So it&amp;#39;s pretty unlikely that your book
 would be full. So now the hourly rate is $125/hour. The $125 basic rate also accounts for
 variability in billing: Such as: Customers who don&amp;#39;t pay; customers who make only partial payment;
 customers who get a discount for various intangible reasons. This is also why the rate goes down
 for a longer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are various forms of overhead. Independent contractors also need to pay for their own
 health care and consulting insurance; their taxes can be higher, especially if they don&amp;#39;t have a
 good accountant; and they have to pay for ongoing self-education, in the form of books,
 subscriptions, and non-billable hours in open source projects they participate in. So let us say,
 now, that a &amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot; rate is $150. They may also have to pay for an office; add $10/hour,
 at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why $200? Now we get into questions around quality. You want the best, don&amp;#39;t you? The rate is
 going to be a bell curve like everything else, with the $150/hour biller in the middle. You are
 going to be able to find people for $75/hour; and there are going to be great people who are in
 high demand who require a larger number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So have I convinced you that $200 is reasonable for great work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Invoicing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst thing we do when we build a contract is to make it expensive to stop the work. A good way
to make it expensive is to torture yourself and the contractor to define all of the work upfront
with a defined schedule, and then introduce charges for changes. Please, stop it. Define your work
in two-week sprints that deliver what is most important first. This means that the customer and
the contractor must talk about priorities and get that right. At the end of two weeks, has anything
been delivered? Yes: Continue. No: Consider stopping right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suggest sending the bill at the end of each sprint. Keep the sprint short enough (two weeks
or a week) so that if the customer doesn&amp;#39;t pay you haven&amp;#39;t lost too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, insist on payment. I made the mistake once of letting owed money mount up over
three months, and the the customer went out of business. Oops. I was out $10,000. I know others
who have experienced this. It&amp;#39;s not cool and everyone will be unhappy. So insist on prompt payment.
Be nice, but be persistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and creating invoices? Use software. When I was doing a lot of billing, I used Freckle which is
now &lt;a href="https://nokotime.com/"&gt;Noko Time&lt;/a&gt;. You track your hours, and out the other end comes a pretty
invoice, ready for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is about why and how I decided to get the &lt;a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP"&gt;CISSP Certification&lt;/a&gt;, and how
I studied to pass the exam. I don&amp;#39;t put a lot of stock in certs but I saw
some strategic reasons to do this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been at Iora Health since 2011. When Iora started, our business model
did not involve the submission of medical claims. Having in those very early days no business relationships
with insurance companies, we thought for a brief while that we would not be obligated by HIPAA.
Soon enough, though, our business did start working with insurance companies,
and that meant we had to stand up a HIPAA program. My colleague Andrew Schutzbank
became the HIPAA Privacy Officer, and I became the HIPAA Security Officer. We
wrote all of the initial policies and procedures, trained the staff, and
began conducting periodic security/privacy reviews and walk-throughs of our practices. &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/cissp-85eb1ee2.jpg" title="CISSP Resources" alt="CISSP" width="1000" height="750" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have continued as Security Officer. In 2016 I led up the effort
to obtain &lt;a href="https://hitrustalliance.net/"&gt;HITRUST Certification&lt;/a&gt; for the company, and that required a complete
overhaul of our policies, and a new effort to be able to prove, through evidence,
that we are doing all the things we say we do. As a part of that, we
started making deeper inquiries with our business partners about their security.
We obtained our HITRUST Cert in 2017. Over those years security has become
a top priority for the company and in my personal professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About this time, I noticed that many of my opposite numbers at other companies
have the CISSP certification. It occurred to me that just as HITRUST helps the
company show that we do the right things and take those things seriously,
we should probably have someone at the company who has proved out competencies
as tested by the CISSP. In September of 2019 I began to study in earnest. Here&amp;#39;s
what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before 2017 I had obtained the Sybex CISSP Study Guide, 7th edition, because
I was curious about the CISSP. In September 2019 I bought the Sybex sample exams, and
quickly noticed that there were questions that weren&amp;#39;t addressed by the 7th
Edition of the Study Guide. So I acquired the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Information-Security-Professional-Official/dp/1119475937/"&gt;8th edition of the Study Guide&lt;/a&gt; and read it cover-to-cover
(except for the software chapters - more about that below). The lead author
of that book is Mike Chapple: I also watched all of his CISSP videos on Lynda/LinkedIn
(until recently, Lynda was free via many public libraries; but apparently no more).
Coupled with the Sybex books are some online quizzes and tests. I found I could
pretty easily get an 80% or better on any domain. But I had this nagging suspicion that
the Sybex book was a little thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November I started checking in with CISSP communities on Facebook and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.
(There&amp;#39;s also a nice group on Discord.)
Based on what I was reading there, I discovered that the CISSP examination is
pretty well understood to have questions that are qualitatively different from
many of the electronic practice exams. The CISSP tends to ask more sophisticated
questions, and often turns on subtle wording or qualification of the main question.
For example, a prompt may be prefaced by: &amp;quot;With regard to risk analysis . . .&amp;quot;
and then ask a question that might have a pretty obvious answer in the general
case, but perhaps not so obvious when thinking narrowly about risk analysis.
When you take the CISSP you sign an NDA, so I can&amp;#39;t write very freely about
my own experience: Suffice to say that the guidance from Reddit and elsewhere
is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a lot of talk online about the &lt;a href="https://www.boson.com/practice-exam/cissp-isc2-practice-exam"&gt;CISSP prep exams from Boson&lt;/a&gt;. 
The big difference with Boson is that you can read their rather lengthy
rationale for the correct answer, coupled with an enumeration of the reasons
the wrong answers don&amp;#39;t work. After some Boson prep in December, I found that
I could pretty reliably score 80-100% in most domains for questions I&amp;#39;d
never seen. The one I had trouble with? Software development, where I have
the most professional experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the problem with the software development domain for the CISSP is that it&amp;#39;s
hard to test. What you want in a software developer (or perhaps more pertinantly in a
software developer manager with a focus on information security) is a very broad ability to exercise the sniff test
on what is going on. For instance, you have to have some sensitivity to the
idea that a two-tier web app with unsanitized database queries and no input
validation might expose you to SQL injection. Well obviously I know that.
But how do you test it? A question seemingly beloved by the electronic prep
exams is along the lines of: What is the top vulnerability according to the &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/"&gt;OWASP Top Ten&lt;/a&gt;?
Well, in 2017 it was injection. But the problem here is that the question
is geared to what is easy to test. So presumably some people are going to
memorize the whole OWASP Top Ten because it occurs on a prep exam. In my
experience, there were a lot of prep questions that were too granular for a commonsense
approach to secure software development. In any case, it was clear that I had
to learn about managing secure software development &amp;quot;the CISSP way.&amp;quot; What I
did for this was to pay close attention to what I got wrong, and then read
in the late Shon Harris&amp;#39;s book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CISSP-All-One-Guide-Eighth/dp/1260142655/"&gt;CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide, Eighth Edition&lt;/a&gt;.
This rather amazing book can serve as a nice desktop reference/refresher for
most topics in IT Security, from what I can tell. Another great resource
for cleaning up weak areas is the (free) series of videos on the CISSP by
&lt;a href="https://www.cybrary.it/course/cissp/"&gt;Kelly Handerhan at Cybrary&lt;/a&gt;. Handerhan
also has has some great videos on individual topics: For instance, I don&amp;#39;t
think I would have understood Kerberos very well without &lt;a href="https://www.cybrary.it/s3ss10n/kerberos-in-depth/"&gt;her walk-through&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there&amp;#39;s no one-size-fits-all study plan, but I think what I did
makes a lot of sense, in retrospect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I read systematically (virtually cover-to-cover) in the newest official study guide.
I underlined and added notes in this volume, and kept my own separate
notes as a personal study guide.
I also watched
the videos on Lynda/LinkedIn because I have found over the years that I
learn better if I cover the materials in more than one mode (reading &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; videos).
You need this breadth before you can selectively go deeper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Boson prep was essential, because it helps you differentiate between
the different acronyms, use cases, and contexts for questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Finally, for touch-ups I used Shon Harris and to a lesser extent various
Kelly Handerhan videos. For me, if I&amp;#39;m weak in an area,
I have to go deeper so that the shallow stuff becomes just background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The day before I reviewed the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.sunflower-cissp.com/"&gt;&amp;quot;Sunflower&amp;quot; CISSP summary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the value of the CISSP? I&amp;#39;m not sure. The exam is now adaptive, and I
passed it after the minimum number of questions (100), apparently satisfying
a 95% confidence internal suggesting I&amp;#39;d pass with the full 150 questions. Online,
people counseled: &amp;quot;Think like a manager&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;remember the
information security triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)&amp;quot;;
watch carefully for questions that are driven by budget, not necessarily
what is most secure. Those are excellent guidelines for the test experience,
but it is a shame that few of the practice questions, from what I can tell,
work at that level. One book that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to
be used much by people prepping for the exam is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Official-ISC-Guide-CISSP-CBK/dp/1119423341/"&gt;CISSP &amp;quot;body of knowledge&amp;quot;
book&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m going to be using that to get some further depth, because unlike
the other books, it seems to be much better at citing source documents on
which the CISSP knowledge is based.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Second Visit to Bates College</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oops. This has been unpublished in draft since October. But since then, my daughter &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;
apply to Bates early decision, and was admitted to the class of 2024!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s my take from back in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 26-28, we returned to New England to continue our visits to colleges,
and a key aspect of this trip was to see if my daughter&amp;#39;s very strong interest
in Bates is still solid. Why? Because she might apply there &amp;quot;early decision.&amp;quot;
We also visited Middlebury, Mount Holyoke, and Amherst. I may get to
these in later posts. Oh, and we had a couple
of quick drive-bys: Hampshire and Goddard Colleges. I wish we could have lingered,
but we had some car trouble that made our schedules tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want say a few words about Bates . . . then bloviate a bit on
early decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/2018/08/visits-to-bates-college/"&gt;Bates was the third college I blogged about&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="/category/college-visits/"&gt;this series&lt;/a&gt;,
and back in August of last year, I concluded that it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;A great school that
has perhaps had to be a bit more cunning and creative about costs than their
cohort.&amp;quot; &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2019-10-bates-01.JPG" title="Bates 2019 1" alt="bates-2019-01" width="800" height="949" /&gt; Everything we saw and experienced at Bates confirmed that opinion. C is still bullish on Bates. Me, too. I&amp;#39;ll just pick out a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we skipped the tour. Instead, we snooped around the
campus on our own, which was quite rewarding. The best modern building at
Bates is Pettengill Hall. &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2019-10-bates-02-4745dae7.png" title="Bates 2019 2" alt="bates-2019-02" width="791" height="1054" /&gt; On the tour last year, we got to see the main
floor; the tour guide said that in winter it&amp;#39;s like a &amp;quot;snow globe&amp;quot; with its
big windows and pretty views. This time we discovered that on the upper
floors, there are cozy lounges and great views of the interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature of Bates that really impressed me is that seemingly every
department has a lounge. &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2019-10-bates-05-b3a576be.png" title="Bates 2019 3" alt="bates-2019-05" width="800" height="808" /&gt; I like the idea that each department has a little
retreat where they can show off some collections related to the field and
provide a shelf of faculty-authored books. So, for instance, in the German
and Russian Department, we saw a case with some old Samovars. It&amp;#39;s a nice touch.
I have seen a bit of that at Grinnell, but at Bates it seemed to be systematic.
We were there while Bates was in session, but I don&amp;#39;t think we saw anyone hanging
out in a lounge. I can tell you that were I a student again, I&amp;#39;d surely be
a denizen of the English Department&amp;#39;s lounge!
The
most interesting space we saw was the French department, which has decorated
the walls with sentences from famous works of literature. &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2019-10-bates-04-204831d6.png" title="Bates 2019 4" alt="bates-2019-04" width="800" height="728" /&gt; One felt that one
was &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot; French. I recall that Montaigne decorated his reading room with
snippets of Latin from the ancients; maybe the department was echoing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I worried a bit about the endowment. I have come to believe that this
is a non-issue for a couple of reasons. First off, &lt;a href="https://www.bates.edu/campaign/"&gt;Bates has apparently been
quite successful with their current capital campaign&lt;/a&gt;.
Another sign that their budgets are not constraining them is that there is
a new science building going up, due to open when my daughter would be in
her sophomore year. For Bates, this is important, because judging from the
existing buildings, they don&amp;#39;t have the powerhouse labs you see at, say,
Grinnell, Amherst, and Mount Holyoke. But &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; will help, and what I expect to see is not
quite the obsession with research you see at these other schools, but rather
an even stronger integration of the sciences into the liberal arts. Bates tends
to do things in their own way, such as their strategic naming of their new
department, &amp;quot;Digital and Computational Studies.&amp;quot; My prediction is that a new
science builidng at Bates will be very accomodating to the current debates
around ethics in the sciences as well as the history of science, both areas
where you need that liberal arts approach to get the most integrative educational
experience.
The fact that Bates doesn&amp;#39;t have money to blow means that they have to be
ever more clever in spending what they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Early Decision&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this whole &amp;quot;early decision&amp;quot; thing . . . The idea is that if a kid is sure that
Somewhere College is the exact right place, then the kid applies &amp;quot;early decision&amp;quot;
to that one school. If accepted, attendance is required. You can&amp;#39;t then apply to Someother College and
get in there and rescind your attendance from the school to which you
applied early decision. No. ED is binding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just want to jump to the &lt;em&gt;cui bono&lt;/em&gt;. Clearly colleges benefit big time.
Here&amp;#39;s what Wikipedia says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools which offer an ED admission plan look to benefit from a near certainty
that the admitted applicant will attend. As a result, the admission yield is
increased by admitting more students at the ED stage. The timing of the ED
process also helps admissions offices spread the work of sifting through
applications throughout more of the school year. [...] Many schools offering ED
regularly fill over 50% of their class through ED admits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got that? So colleges get a better handle on class makeup and can effectively
&amp;quot;lock in&amp;quot; their student body earlier. The chances of being admitted ED are higher
than for the regular admissions process. What&amp;#39;s more, as James Fallows writes in
&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/09/the-early-decision-racket/302280/"&gt;a seminal article on ED in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;The more freshmen a college admits under a binding ED plan, the fewer acceptances it needs from the regular pool to fill its class—and the better it will look statistically.&amp;quot; No
college would admit the following, but if the college is &amp;quot;need aware,&amp;quot; meaning
that the college can look at the income of the parents as a part of the consideration
to admit, then the college might also lock in more cash instead of competing for
students later on through the offering of aid and scholarships. Which students
benefit from this? The logic means that
the early decision kids are the rich kids, because they don&amp;#39;t care as much about the variety of aid packages they might get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that I noted that the admit percentage is higher for ED. So if you&amp;#39;re
a student who really wants to lock in a school, you&amp;#39;re going to apply ED to
get that advantage.
What is really worrisome here is that ED may be prone to gaming, and it distorts the
very proposition that your ED school is the one you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to go to. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/03/31/a-college-admissions-edge-for-the-wealthy-early-decision/"&gt;An
article in the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes admission to that first-choice school is so tough to obtain, even in an early application, that it makes more sense to apply early decision to a second choice, or even a third choice. “You’ve got one chip,” Reider said. “One card to play. It’s an absolutely crazy system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t that seem a bit off? So my daughter, at least, will likely apply ED to what seems
like her favorite school, and may have a higher liklihood of getting in. But
one does wonder about increasing the chances by going for, say, Mount Holyoke (and
I&amp;#39;m not knocking Mount Holyoke, just noting their statistics for ED).
I suppose that Washington Post article, though, is about the kids who want to
go to a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; selective school like Harvard or Princeton. My daughter decided
long ago that she&amp;#39;d rather go to a smaller place, and while still very selective,
it&amp;#39;s a different world from the top 5-10 most selective institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On September 13th my daughter, my wife, and I flew from the Twin Cities to Des Moines to take my daughter
(I&amp;#39;ll call her C)
on a college visit to &lt;a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/"&gt;Grinnell College&lt;/a&gt; in Grinnell, Iowa. This would be an
interesting visit, because I graduated from Grinnell in 1982, and then worked
there for two years, and have been
back to campus numerous times to give talks and go to reunion. Our &amp;quot;blink&amp;quot;
was that Grinnell might not be a great fit for C, but she was game to check
it out. I have 
friends there: Some with whom I went to college, others who are from the
younger generation of faculty (i.e., people my own age). I&amp;#39;ll say a word or two about C&amp;#39;s experience, and will
also reflect on the differences between Grinnell then and Grinnell now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first we got in
our rental car and drove to Montour, Iowa, to have dinner at &lt;a href="https://www.rubessteakhouse-montour.com/"&gt;Rube&amp;#39;s Steakhouse&lt;/a&gt;,
where &lt;em&gt;you grill your own steak&lt;/em&gt;. We visited with my friends Harriett and Jeff
who after living elsewhere in the country settled in Grinnell. They have a lovely
life, and it was great to catch up but also to learn a bit about their daughter&amp;#39;s
college choice--she went to Smith College. What I remember about the conversation
was that their daughter just felt the vibe. This seems to be the most real
thing about picking a college: something just grabs you. Honestly, picking
a college is the United States&amp;#39; version of the &amp;quot;sorting hat&amp;quot; in Harry Potter,
am I right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steak was great, but without
my meat thermometer I overcooked a bit. &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2019-09-rubes1-b034095a.jpg" title="Rubes 1" alt="rubes11" width="601" height="597" /&gt; &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2019-09-rubes2-6d0cca1f.jpg" title="Rubes 2" alt="rubes12" width="467" height="368" /&gt; My theory of Rube&amp;#39;s is that because the
lighting on the grill is so dark people tend to cook it more rare than they
would usually . . . and that&amp;#39;s why they like their steak so much! But this
time I foiled my own theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we drove on to Grinnell and stayed at the new &lt;a href="https://www.hotelgrinnell.com/"&gt;Hotel Grinnell&lt;/a&gt;, which is in
the building that was formerly the junior high, and long ago the high school.
We had a big room with two beds. The place was pretty funky: Our room had a
photo of a stack of 80s-era albums in the bathroom, and there was the
predictable (the first album by the English Beat), and the -- really? -- whut?
(&amp;quot;Too Drunk to F---&amp;quot; by the Dead Kennedys.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d share some photos but it would seem that I took only one picture while I
was in Grinnell. Hmm. I guess I was so involved in the moment taking pictures
with my mind that I neglected to take pictures with my phone. I grabbed some
from my wife&amp;#39;s phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday, September 13, showed a really big harvest moon, which we noticed on
our drive from Montour to Grinnell. C and I decided to walk up to
campus to see it and also check out the campus at night when it&amp;#39;s especially
pretty. Grinnell has done a good job of situating buildings so that they have
a nice glow when it&amp;#39;s dark. There are now about four key nighttime visual beacons.
First there is the Forum, which in my day was the student center. It&amp;#39;s a glass,
wood, and metal modernist structure designed by Walter Netsch (who is famous
for the Air Force Academy building in Colorado Springs). &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2019-09-gc4-e43d75b5.jpg" title="Grinnell College 4" alt="gc4" width="800" height="817" /&gt; Netsch also designed
Burling Library and the Arts building. I read in an old piece of his (that
I have unsuccessfully strived to find online) that the rooflines of the Forum,
Library, and Theater were designed to align horizontally. You can still see that, but
unfortunately the library was defaced in the 1980s by a grotesque popup on the top to provide
for extra stacks. In any case, C could see the visual harmony across
these buildings. Then we walked over to South Campus. Grinnell&amp;#39;s dormitories
are small but connected via loggias into three campuses, South, North, and
East. This creates a really appealing view with lights glowing out of the loggias.
The third visual beacon is the Joe Rosenfield Center (JRC), which is the new 
(since 2007) student center. It&amp;#39;s a multi-use building that contains the single
dining hall. (In my day, there were two places to eat: Quad, which still stands on South
Campus and would fit right in at Hogwarts, and the more utilitarian Cowles on North Campus.
When I was a student I liked the choice, but now after many campus visits, I
see that many colleges are coalescing their dining experiences into one larger hall in order
to facilitate a common experience.)
The JRC had people coming in and going out and seemed warm and inviting. The last
visual beacon I want to pick out is the brand new Humanities and Social Studies
Center (popularly now known as the HSSC, pronounced &amp;quot;husk&amp;quot;). &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2019-09-gc1-63232b47.jpg" title="Grinnell College 1" alt="gc1" width="800" height="1067" /&gt; It&amp;#39;s quite a
behemoth, and partially encloses the old Alumni Recitation Hall (ARH). A lot
of alumni were pretty worried about this construction. It&amp;#39;s huge and
transformative. It is so big that it closes off the central campus and eliminates
the view from there to the north. However, I&amp;#39;d count it as a total
success. The main thing that is does is increase the coziness and warmth of
the central campus. It makes that core feel even more &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; (a theme to which
I will return).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C felt the warmth: It&amp;#39;s a very &amp;quot;managed&amp;quot; space with everything
conveniently within walking distance. Now that I&amp;#39;ve visited a lot of campuses
where things seem a little too spread out (Middlebury; Amherst; etc.) I think
Grinnell has something pretty neat. The college owns a lot of acres but
they have situated the core buildings elegantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we had the info session, tour, and then C had an
interview. &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2019-09-gc3-aef858e8.jpg" title="Grinnell College 3" alt="gc3" width="1000" height="750" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I&amp;#39;ve discovered in all of these campus visits is that the
top tier of small liberal arts colleges all have pretty much the same core
elements: a great faculty, fantastic resources, and an inviting student culture:
so the visit tends to turn on the little differences (sometimes not so little).
Here are a few things about Grinnell that stood out in the visit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grinnell College is in the middle of Iowa, in the town of Grinnell (pop. 9,000,
not including the students). This is apparently perceived by some as &amp;quot;remote&amp;quot; so the
college has to address it in various ways. (Honestly, it&amp;#39;s no more remote from
larger urban areas than, say, Middlebury, which doesn&amp;#39;t seem to get this critique). It&amp;#39;s about a one hour drive from Des Moines (to 
the west) or Iowa City (to the east). Like a lot of high-performing small colleges,
Grinnell attracts students from all over the world, and is not shy
telling that story. Most Grinnell students do at least a semester abroad. So, yeah,
the college is in Iowa, but it is very much &amp;quot;of the world&amp;quot; as well. I&amp;#39;d say the college is
entirely successful promoting its international character; yet they have to be careful
not to sound apologetic for being in the cornfields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the college
promotes its &lt;a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/centers-programs/prairie-studies"&gt;Center for Prairie Studies&lt;/a&gt;.
Some years ago in 2013-2014, Grinnell engaged what was then known as Crane
Meta Marketing to provide some insights on the college&amp;#39;s identity.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="ref1" href="#note1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
I read
a lot of their research and like all consultancies, they produced a feeling
of anxiety by identifying paradoxes about the college; they presented a couple
of &amp;quot;solutions&amp;quot; to these paradoxes. I think one was the idea of centering
Grinnell&amp;#39;s image on the idea of the prairie. But here&amp;#39;s the thing. Yes, there is
history around the prairie and there is some nearby restored prairie, but you know what?
Grinnell&amp;#39;s farming country. Really. I don&amp;#39;t think the college has every &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt;
taken that to heart as a component of the college identity (you could probably
argue that it&amp;#39;s been in [intentional?] denial about that since founding). I learned in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mentor-Life-Legacy-Joe-Rosenfield/dp/0998652857/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=george+drake+rosenfield&amp;amp;qid=1569772518&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;George Drake&amp;#39;s book on Joe Rosenfield&lt;/a&gt;
that for many years until the 1940s a chief source of income for the college was from
local farms it owned (p. 162). But despite the geographical location, there is no Farm Studies Concentration on campus.
I would guess a name like &amp;quot;Farm Studies&amp;quot; would be too pedestrian for a national
elite college,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="ref2" href="#note2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but it would certainly respect the surrounding reality and
given the lively Iowa interest in artisanal produce, it would be hip. (Though see &lt;a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/news/grinnell-farms-0"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; nice piece.)
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans#Geographic_distribution"&gt;Iowa is also among the &amp;quot;whitest&amp;quot; states in the USA&lt;/a&gt;: The curriculum has many courses
that critique whiteness and/or study other populations in the spirit of area
studies, languages, or arts, but there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;Midwest Studies&amp;quot; to my knowledge (when
I was a student, then professor Liahna Babener taught a course on the
literature and culture of the American midwest but I don&amp;#39;t think it really
had a slot in the course list the way, say, English Literature did).
Yet Iowa is not as uniform as its image: Waterloo, Iowa, is more
than 15% African American. &lt;a href="https://www.thegazette.com/iowaideas/stories/iowa-changing-demographics"&gt;Projections suggest that Iowa will decrease from
something like 90% white-non-Hispanic to about 75% by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, so there&amp;#39;s a lot
to think about. Maybe &amp;quot;Iowa Studies&amp;quot;? Joseph Wall, a key Grinnell College history
professor, wrote &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Iowa-Bicentennial-Joseph-Frazier-Wall/dp/B002K7X9CC"&gt;a standard brief history of Iowa&lt;/a&gt;; maybe that&amp;#39;s the way to incorporate a scholarly involvement with &amp;quot;place.&amp;quot; My point is simply that there&amp;#39;s something for the college
to examine in the ongoing transformation of Iowa. The college &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;
strongly emphasize &lt;a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/campus-life/grinnell"&gt;the town of Grinnell&lt;/a&gt;.
There are some who are going to argue that, yes, the college does a lot with
the nearby area and the local ethnic patterns and folkways; I&amp;#39;m just saying that the emphasis on
&amp;quot;place&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t as profound as you see in the &amp;quot;sell&amp;quot; you get from institutions like
Bates (strongly argues for the college&amp;#39;s relationship to the class structure of Lewiston/Auburn and to the
local francophone communities) or Middlebury (which wears its Vermontness like
a pair of overalls).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of campuses, I have to say that the resources in
the sciences are truly amazing. It seems that most if not all science faculty
have their own lab or space that is dedicated to research, and, critically,
research with undergraduate collaboration. The Noyce Science Building is quite utilitarian but
I like that -- it looks like a place where real science happens. The embedded Science Library has a lot of windows
overlooking the JRC: It&amp;#39;s a pleasant
place to study on a cold winter night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new HSSC is astounding. It has not only more space for the humanities
and social sciences, but it seems designed as a sort of agora for the free
flow of ideas, with whiteboards everywhere and what looks like an outdoor
classroom. The building has a lot of network connectivity and the college
now has even more opportunities for real-time video classroom sharing with
other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So those are just some differentiators. The tour was great, clear, and non-braggy.
For C, Grinnell seemed a little &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; on college traditions and customs, with which she
is fascinated. After the tour and interview, C placed Grinnell in the &amp;quot;plausible&amp;quot;
category for application. For her, it didn&amp;#39;t make the grade as a potential
early decision commitment, but it&amp;#39;s viable for the regular round of applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is Grinnell different in 2019 from what I experienced in the 1980s? When I entered
Grinnell in 1978, there was still a remnant of hippie culture. In central Iowa,
I think the cultural movement of the coastal &amp;quot;sixties&amp;quot; was delayed by maybe three years
(even though &lt;a href="http://www.thesandb.com/arts/1966-jefferson-airplane-lands-in-grinnell.html"&gt;the Jefferson Airplane played Grinnell in 1966&lt;/a&gt;), and lingered by that much as well. So students who were about to graduate in 1979 would have
started in 1975, and would have overlapped with the tail end of the sixties
kids -- among them, young men who were still subject to the draft (which ended
in 1973). So there was in my day the circumambient smell of pot and I would say that the campus was
pretty laid back, with a student-called &amp;quot;skip day&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;Grinnell Relays&amp;quot; which was
a parody of the Drake Relays. There was in 1978 a new law raising the drinking age to
19, but many students admitted in 1978 were grandfathered in to be allowed to
drink at 18. I think this younger drinking age actually de-emphasized the role of alcohol on campus.
As the years proceeded and alcohol became illegal for more students, it became
more of a forbidden fruit, and I believe the preferred inebriant on campus switched
from pot to beer. Meanwhile in 1980 Reagan was elected, and I swear to you
that the college culture became a little more straight; some incoming students seemed
a bit more free to show their relative wealth. George Drake became
President of the college in 1979, and he revived the idea of athletics as
a key component of the college experience. Then in the mid-1980s Grinnell students,
as on a lot of campuses, organized to promote divestment of college funds from
companies doing business in South Africa. My point is simply that it was a
complicated time, but, essentially, laid back enough that students didn&amp;#39;t
feel a lot of pressure to excel in any conventional way. Additionally, my
guess is that Grinnell was an oddball compared to the schools it compared itself
to back then: Its (apparent) isolation made it a place that could just &lt;em&gt;do
its thing&lt;/em&gt;. There were fewer articles like this trying to compare and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today: I think Grinnell has evolved into a school where academics and academic
achievement really are at the center of the experience. Grinnell seems not
quite a &amp;quot;grind&amp;quot; school (as I think may be the case at Carleton), but it is certainly a college where everything is
intentional. In my time, Grinnell was more haphazard . . . less professional . . .
more bespoke . . . more weird. Is Grinnell now really &lt;em&gt;that different&lt;/em&gt; from its &lt;a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/about-grinnell/leadership-and-administration/offices-and-services/analytic-support-and-0"&gt;peer institutions&lt;/a&gt; these
days? I&amp;#39;m not so sure (more about this in a later blog post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I promised to say something about the feeling of &amp;quot;safety&amp;quot; at Grinnell.
A few years ago I was talking to someone at Reunion and we were comparing notes
about coming to Grinnell. Her parents had been going through a divorce. (Mine, too.)
She was from the Twin Cities, and didn&amp;#39;t really enjoy the bustle of the city. (Me, too.)
So when she visited Grinnell in its carefully-placed setting, she immediately
felt &amp;quot;safe.&amp;quot; This was a big deal for me as well: A jewel of the prairie where
I could study what I wanted, be what I wanted, become what I wanted, and grow and thrive.
It was a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endnotes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="note1" href="#ref1"&gt;1.&lt;/a&gt; N.b.,
these kinds of branding exercises in higher education really bugs me:
they are corporatist, and the very notion that colleges have to hire outsiders
to tell them who they are seems pretty sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="note2" href="#ref2"&gt;2.&lt;/a&gt; Grinnell is an important player in the town,
but it&amp;#39;s interesting to me that some colleges with a national reputation don&amp;#39;t
participate in local events. For instance, Macalester College never has a booth
at the Minnesota State Fair or, say, at the Selby Jazz Festival, while other
Minnesota-/Twin Cities-based institutions do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I write this, the Minneapolis/St. Paul airport (MSP) is really screwed up.
&lt;a href="http://tcbmag.com/news/articles/2019/august/msp-airport-renovations-prompt-checkpoint-changes"&gt;They&amp;#39;re renovating one of the two major entry points for security lanes.&lt;/a&gt;
Hoi polloi must use the North checkpoint: It&amp;#39;s slow! Really slow!! But if you have TSA
Pre you can use the South checkpoint. &lt;em&gt;Believe me, you want the South checkpoint.&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;#39;s fast! Really fast!!
It&amp;#39;s going to be maybe 10 minutes, max. Otherwise, right now, it&amp;#39;s like a 45
minute wait. It can be even worse in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pay someone $140K/year, that&amp;#39;s an hourly wage of about $70.
&lt;a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/what-difference-between-global-entry-tsa-precheck-and-other-trusted"&gt;The fee for TSA Pre is only $85. Throw in Global Entry, and it&amp;#39;s $100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s see. Your employee doesn&amp;#39;t have TSA Pre. On each end of a trip, she&amp;#39;s
going to spend 45 minus 10, or 35 minutes in line without TSA Pre. Round-trip, that&amp;#39;s 70 minutes, or
more than an hour. If you paid that mere $85, your $140K employee wouldn&amp;#39;t waste
those 70 minutes, so it&amp;#39;s a wash in terms of your budget. You spend a whopping
$85, and after about one trip, you get it back in time not wasted on standing
in line. Spend $100 (oh my!) and now the employee can do Global Entry and blast
through customs and immigration. So, yeah, your employee doesn&amp;#39;t do much
international travel for work . . . But she&amp;#39;s going to love you if you can
expedite dealing with all that crap at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally implore my colleagues to sign up for TSA Pre. Do they do it? Nope. It&amp;#39;s a bit
of a hassle, and in the default situation, everyone wears the tinfoil hat and
is paranoid about sharing personal biometrics such as fingerprints. But I think
a cash &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIssrR9ZXZ5AIVFarsCh0dcgg0EAAYASAAEgIlFvD_BwE&amp;amp;hvadid=241594665112&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9019537&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;amp;hvqmt=e&amp;amp;hvrand=9001107170725452048&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-337408379473&amp;amp;hydadcr=15493_10339808&amp;amp;keywords=nudge+the+book&amp;amp;qid=1568768462&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;nudge&lt;/a&gt;
can overcome this objection pretty quickly. So . . . why not offer to reimburse your staff for their TSA Pre bill? You
won&amp;#39;t lose much cash, and you will gain in reputation as being a considerate and
supportive employer. Indeed, after a couple of trips, you&amp;#39;ll start to get
