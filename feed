    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been awhile since I&amp;#39;ve posted anything here, which is terrible but I have reasons. 2022 and 2023 were tough years. My dad died
in January of 2022, and the prior four months or so involved a lot of caregiving. Then after that, there was
straightening out his affairs and his apartment. At the end of 2018, mom died, too. So that&amp;#39;s two
significant deaths, and their aftermaths, over a bit more than 3 years. These 
years were also dominated by acqusitions: First, Iora was aquired by One Medical in September of
2021, which brought a lot of integration work into 2022. Then in 2023, One Medical
was acquired by Amazon. At Iora I had been the VP of Technology, including security and technology
compliance; in July of 2022 I became the Senior Director of Information Security at One Medical.
So things have been busy with a lot of changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I look back on these years, it&amp;#39;s intersting that I did manage to read 53 books in 2021, which
must have been a kind of salve and distraction after mom died. Since 2021, though I read a paltry (for me)
33 and 30 books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think I&amp;#39;m going to take this as a resolution and challenge for 2024: Read more. This is probably
going to be a good year for not reading the paper and getting too caught up in politics, which I may
need to do anyway, but not as a time-killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2022&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2022-books-read-3cec65f8.png" title="2022 Books Read" alt="2022-books-read.png" width="644" height="1252" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad&amp;#39;s death made
2022 an unsteady year emotionally, and I didn&amp;#39;t feel like reading much that was serious. Maybe
that&amp;#39;s not quite true: Apparently I read the new Franzen but I don&amp;#39;t remember any of it. I
did read a number of the 33 1/3 books on record albums, and that was a good distraction -- really comfort
reading for me.  I re-read
some books: Curtis Sittenfeld&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3794491615"&gt;Prep&lt;/a&gt; and Donna Tartt&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4540812965"&gt;The Secret History&lt;/a&gt;. More comfort reading
(though the books are not really so comforting come to think of it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on 2022, probably the two best things I read were about the state of Maine, where my
daughter is going to college. I read &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/103986.The_Lobster_Coast?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=lbHUiKIU71&amp;amp;rank=1"&gt;The Lobster Coast&lt;/a&gt;, a history, and &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58988394-the-midcoast?ref=rae_0"&gt;The Midcoast&lt;/a&gt;, a novel that
takes that history into account. Both highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also read some work-related books on security and gave 5 stars to Nicole Pelroth&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3806829965"&gt;This is
How They Tell Me the World Ends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2023-books-read-0c7640f1.png" title="2023 Books Read" alt="2023-books-read.png" width="639" height="1076" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read fewer books in 2023 than in 2022! That makes me look back on 2021, 2019, and 2018 and
wonder how I got so much read. The big standout for 2023 was a collection of books about Amazon:
all pretty good; the one I would recommend to others is &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5406985629"&gt;Working Backwards&lt;/a&gt;. I read these because
the acquisition of One Medical by Amazon was finalized in February. Actually the best read about
Amazon was a critique: Kristi Coulter&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65215677-exit-interview?from_search=true&amp;amp;from_srp=true&amp;amp;qid=izsfsGM496&amp;amp;rank=1"&gt;Exit Interview&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;#39;d say more about this but I think as a current employee I should stay mum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;And what about 2024?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a list called &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/141355-john?ref=nav_mybooks&amp;amp;shelf=books-i-should-stop-putting-off"&gt;&amp;quot;Books I should Stop Putting Off&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
all killer, no filler, and all non-fiction. If I had to pick one to move to the top of my list, it would probably be &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52269471-mindf-ck"&gt;the one on Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;. I have noticed that when I mention Cambridge Analytica to
people, they don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m talking about, and I should be at the ready for more of the story and the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I need a new list of fiction that I should prioritize.  Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/141355-john?ref=nav_mybooks&amp;amp;shelf=prioritized-fiction-recent"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Goodreads, I know what books I completed in the past year. I also participated in the
Goodreads &amp;quot;reading challenge&amp;quot; where you promise to read some number of books. I promised 53, and
managed to complete 53. This is more than I typically finish: I think the pandemic had something
to do with it. Also, strangely, I had to fly quite a lot this year, despite the pandemic, and that
provided a lot of time for getting to the final pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking over the year, among the fiction
I most enjoyed and would recommend are: &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/2021-books-read-2bacd531.png" title="2021 Books Read" alt="2021-books-read.png" width="512" height="1582" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/books/review/the-sentence-louise-erdrich.html"&gt;Louise Erdrich, The Sentence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rereading-paula-foxs-desperate-characters"&gt;Paula Fox, Desparate Characters&lt;/a&gt; (from 1970; depressing but amazing: I am going to have to read
everything else she wrote)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/21/best-recent-thrillers-review-roundup-peter-heller-denise-mina"&gt;Peter Heller, The River&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also see some highly-rated (by me) novels that I cannot really recommend;
while they hit the mark for me, I don&amp;#39;t think others would really dig &amp;#39;em. Also, I see where my ratings were a bit off. For instance, I see I gave Amor Towles&amp;#39;s Rules
of Civility 5 stars but gave his A Gentleman in Moscow only 4. I read Gentleman first and thought
its structure was a little haphazard, which is why I downgraded it. But in reflection, I think
it was the better novel, so I&amp;#39;m going to have to subtract a star from Rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In non-fiction, my highest rated are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/30/kill-switch-review-senate-filibuster-republicans-mcconnell-trump"&gt;Adam Jentleson, Kill Switch&lt;/a&gt; (about the United States Senate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/wework-adam-neumann-cult-of-we-review/2021/07/22/769ea784-eaf5-11eb-8950-d73b3e93ff7f_story.html"&gt;Eliot Brown, The Cult of We&lt;/a&gt; (about WeWork; better than the similar Billio Dollar Loser)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-lawlessness-of-medicine/"&gt;Siddhartha Mukherjee, The Laws of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/books/review-curse-of-bigness-antitrust-law-tim-wu.html"&gt;Tim Wu, The Curse of Bigness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the first time in many years when I didn&amp;#39;t have a highly-rated tech book. Another
oddity is that I only read one rock book, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800071527/i-was-singing-for-my-life-amy-rigby-on-mixing-music-and-motherhood"&gt;Amy Rigby&amp;#39;s Girl to City&lt;/a&gt; (excellent). I suppose some
people read more music books when they can&amp;#39;t see music as much (as under the pandemic) but I think
my desire to read more rock books is piqued by the live music experience. On the
other hand, I read 7 books I&amp;#39;d classify as memoir/autobiography; this year, they were all memoir
(as opposed to full-on autobiography).
I gave two of them 5 stars, both by the same author: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/01/biography.features1"&gt;Paula Fox&amp;#39;s Borrowed Finery&lt;/a&gt;, and her
&lt;a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/paula-fox/the-coldest-winter-2/"&gt;The Coldest Winter&lt;/a&gt;. Some surprises in memoir: I gave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTnybQtA19U"&gt;Anna Kendrick&amp;#39;s Scrappy Little Nobody&lt;/a&gt;
a 4 (better than I would have expected) and Elizabeth Hardwick&amp;#39;s celebrated Sleepless Nights a 3 (it was
kind of boring and I didn&amp;#39;t see the rationiale for its artiness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been doing the Challenge since 2016, and here&amp;#39;s how things stack up over the years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center"&gt;Challenge&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center"&gt;Books Read&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right"&gt;Pages&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center"&gt;Length (Avg)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center"&gt;Rating (Avg)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2016&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;8,281&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;276&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;4.1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2017&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;10,166&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;299&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;3.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2018&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;13,692&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;351&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;3.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2019&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;47&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;13,798&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;293&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;4.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2020&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;9,546&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;353&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;3.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2021&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right"&gt;14,631&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;275&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;3.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Challenge&amp;quot; column is the number I strived to read, and &amp;quot;Books&amp;quot; is the actual total. In 2019
I started challenging myself to read 53 books/year but it was only this year that I managed
to satify that expectation. I will admit that I read some shorter books (hence, the smallest
average number of pages since 2016.) You might notice that dip in reading in 2020: My ability
to focus  was disrupted by politics and the 2020 Presidential election. Besides being
completely distracted, I was not the healthiest: I must have gained 15 pounds that I still haven&amp;#39;t
gotten rid of. And lest I forget, I had a spell of afib in February, 2020, that lasted until June:
That really messed up my reading time. On the other hand, while I read fewer pages in 2020, each book was
longer. I suppose looking over this summary, my &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; year of reading is about 40 books of
about 325 pages each, for some 13,000 pages. As I note, I read a lot of shorter books this year
to hit my number (53); so I think that number may be a bit inflated and I should allow myself to read longer
works (on average). So for 2022, I think I&amp;#39;ll challenge myself to 45. I look at the reading tallies
of some of my friends (Ellie: 62 books / 369 pp. average; Kelly: 105/337) and don&amp;#39;t know how they
do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might think that my average rating of about 3.9 is
too high; but I am pretty choosy about what I read, so I&amp;#39;ll stand by that average number. Here&amp;#39;s how I grade.
5 is the highest and 1 is the lowest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A terrible book that I probably didn&amp;#39;t even finish. Poorly written and uninteresting content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A weak book that may have some merit but is essentially forgettable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good book that I might come back to some time. Memorable. Maybe important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-notch. If I had the time I&amp;#39;d re-read it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the image you&amp;#39;ll see two displays for a single weight measurement I conducted recently on a
&lt;a href="https://www.getqardio.com/qardiobase-smart-scale-iphone-android/"&gt;Qardio Base scale&lt;/a&gt;. Qardio sells
a number of devices that can measure various things and report those measurements to your phone. I
have a Qardio Base for my weight, and a Qardio Arm for blood pressure. The first Qardio Base I had
was flaky, and fortunately Qardio replaced it. Yay, Qardio! The new one seems to work pretty well --
except that is does weird things with my measurements, which is the purpose of this post. I use
these devices with my IPhone. These products will save the measurements to Apple Health. But I also
manually copy the measurements over into a spreadsheet so I can see a lot of different data in one
place and analyze them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the image. This is &lt;em&gt;the very same measurement&lt;/em&gt;, only the second display is taking place a
minute later. Note the BMI values. When I stood on the scale and took the measurement, the BMI is
reported as 24.9. &lt;img src="../../../assets/images/rounding-0ea5c86e.png" title="Rounding" alt="rounding.png" width="1520" height="1344" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a minute later, the measurement is 25.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially annoying because 24.9 is in the &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; range, while 25.0 is in the &amp;quot;overweight&amp;quot;
range. So I notice that. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to lose weight recently, and this discrepenacy drives me
pretty crazy. Which is it, Qardio? Get your story straight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I have noticed that the BMI calculation will sometimes change within a few minutes of the
original measurement. The discrepancy can be triggered by completely shutting down the app and
restarting it -- and then looking at your last measurement from the History rather than the live
view. This is a chronic issue. I just saw a fluctuation again this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first reported this issue to Qardio on September 20, 2020. On Oct. 13 I was told: &amp;quot;Our engineering
team has not closed this issue and is still investigating into what may be causing this issue.&amp;quot;
That&amp;#39;s cool. Anyway, it was never fixed. I reported it again on Nov. 20, 2020. I reported it again
on Dec. 5, 2020. I reported it again on April 2, 2021. Every time they suggest updating the app --
which I do. But I think it&amp;#39;s still broken; we&amp;#39;ll see how the latest upgrade goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is actually a really terrible bug. Here&amp;#39;s why: &lt;em&gt;You can&amp;#39;t depend on the display of the
value&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes it changes. This erodes one&amp;#39;s faith in the idea that the device is making an
accurate measurement. It&amp;#39;s an especially bad bug because, really, &lt;em&gt;that&amp;#39;s all the system is supposed
to do&lt;/em&gt;!: Measure a value and report it. It would seem, though, that: (1) Qardio is not able to
recognize that this is a serious bug that undermines one&amp;#39;s faith in their system; and/or (2) they
can&amp;#39;t fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smells like a rounding error to me, and maybe they don&amp;#39;t have control over part of their ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my theory. Let&amp;#39;s say that the original measurement is . . . &lt;code&gt;24.9499&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s displayed, it is rounded to a precision of 1 digit. So &lt;code&gt;24.9499&lt;/code&gt; rounded to the nearest
fractional digit is &lt;code&gt;24.9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think, then, that Qardio saves that reading, &lt;code&gt;24.9499&lt;/code&gt;. But when they save it, they save it
rounded to two digits. This rounding might happen locally on the phone, or on their server or in
Apple Health. Anyway, rounded to two fractional digits, it&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;24.95&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the next time the value is displayed, they look up the saved value (&lt;code&gt;24.95&lt;/code&gt;). They then display
the saved value rounded to one fractional digit. And what is &lt;code&gt;24.95&lt;/code&gt; rounded to one fractional
digit? It&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;25.0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I close, I suppose I should belabor what &amp;quot;rounding&amp;quot; a number can mean. The Ruby documentation
says that a number rounded to &lt;code&gt;ndigits&lt;/code&gt; means &amp;quot;Returns float rounded to the nearest value with a
precision of ndigits decimal digits.&amp;quot; Here&amp;#39;s how one implementation of Ruby does it (I&amp;#39;m looking at
the code from Rubinus
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/blob/master/core/float.rb#L90-L91"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/blob/master/machine/class/float.cpp#L373-L385"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which is
easy to read):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiply the given value &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;10**n&lt;/code&gt;, giving &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get rid of the fractional digits in &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt;, giving &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; minus &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt;= &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt;, set &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;10**n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s try this with &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;24.9499&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;249.499&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;249&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(&lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; minus &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0.499&lt;/code&gt; which is not greater than &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt; so do nothing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return &lt;code&gt;249&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;10**1&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;24.9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s the case with &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;24.9599&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;249.599&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;249&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(&lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; minus &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0.599&lt;/code&gt; which is greater than &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt; so set &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;250&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;return &lt;code&gt;250&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;10**1&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;25.0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this will help Qardio fix their bug.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the pandemic, my wife grading like crazy because of an increased load owing to academic
calendar changes, and my daughter gone off to college, I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of time on my hands. In a
late night moment of weakness, I not only signed up for
&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"&gt;Stanford&amp;#39;s famous Machine Learning course&lt;/a&gt; (videos
by Andrew Ng) on Coursera, but paid for it so as to get a certificate. The next day, I regretted a
bit the expense and time commitment, but paying for it has kept me honest and diligent. My repo
suggests that I started it in September 19th and I finished it at the end of October, passing
everything with 100% (which is not too difficult because you can resubmit until your work is
correct). Now it&amp;#39;s time for a little reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took this course because I wanted to be familiar with the vocabulary -- and I also wanted to get a
feel for the kinds of problems basic machine learning can address. And I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot. So with
regard to those outcomes, the course is a good one. I&amp;#39;m pretty late to the party: based on what I&amp;#39;ve
learned I wish I had taken this some years ago when the course was new. Andrew Ng is of course one
of the leading lights of productionizing machine learning at scale, having founded Google Brain and
then for awhile being the Chief Scientist at Baidu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One great aspect of the course is the way Ng has designed it so that certain concepts come back
later. For instance, linear regression and gradient descent are worked up in the first lectures, and
then return in a discussion of content-based recommendation systems. I love that kind of
reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course, though, is starting to show its age. It really needs a refresh. I guess Ng never went
back to it because he now has a more holistic learning venture,
&lt;a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/"&gt;deeplearning.ai&lt;/a&gt; (which is still delivered through Coursera).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awkward stuff: Every lecture has a number of errata
(&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/resources/UWXuL"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;) -- part of that is
because of the sharp eyes of the millions of students who have enrolled in the course. But the thing
that really gives one pause is the inconsistency of the presentation. In early weeks the slides are
punctuated with &amp;quot;Readings&amp;quot; that summarize the lecture material in a condensed form
(&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/resources/RmTEz"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;), which is great for
review. Later weeks don&amp;#39;t have that. At some point a graduate student contributed some fantastic
lecture notes, but they seem a little uneven. There are some really useful things here: For
instance, each programming assignment has a tutorial to coach students over some of the bumps --
and, most critically, there is test data for each part of the assignment. I wrote tests in code to
verify against the test data that my actual code produces the expected results: This is essentially
what the automatic grader does, but the grader is a black box. The reason the test data is so great
is because sometimes your assignment solution misses some cases that the automatic grader checks:
But the test data has good coverage, so by verifying your code against the test data, you can have
more confidence that your code will pass the grader. And it&amp;#39;s faster: The test data is really pared
down. Anyway, the upshot of this is that to get a full understanding, sometimes impacting the way
you would do the coding assignments, you have to scramble over the assignment&amp;#39;s PDF, the web page
regarding programming the assignment, errata, tutorials, and test cases. At one point in a &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/resources/Uuxg6"&gt;tutorial
for Programming Exercise 4&lt;/a&gt;, the
author says: &amp;quot;This tutorial outlines the process of accomplishing the goals for Programming Exercise
4. The purpose is to create a collection of all the useful yet scattered and obscure knowledge that
otherwise would require hours of frustrating searches.This tutorial is targeted solely at vectorized
implementations.&amp;quot; It just isn&amp;#39;t as unified as it might be. Another thing that is kind of weird is
that it&amp;#39;s entirely clear from the lectures that students should strive for vectorized implementations,
but the tutorials and assignments suggest that some students write loops and don&amp;#39;t get to take
advantage of the speed of Octave&amp;#39;s libraries. It&amp;#39;s kind of incredible to me that looping solutions
are even permitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ng&amp;#39;s style is very soft-spoken if not modest. At the end of the earlier lectures on linear and
logistic regression, he notes to the audience that at this point one probably knows more about
machine learning than a lot of people doing it in Silicon Valley, which is pretty funny and kind of
nice take-down of the Valley. He has some tics, for instance, he likes to say &amp;quot;concretely&amp;quot; which I
guess is math talk for &amp;quot;now I&amp;#39;m going to get down to a case.&amp;quot; Another moment is when Ng will say
that he&amp;#39;s not going to prove something or derive something: This is almost always followed by an
appeal to intuition where he says &amp;quot;you know&amp;quot; how something is -- and I would say he&amp;#39;s compelling in
explaining without a lot of math. There are some interesting pedagogical tricks. For instance, about
2/3 of the way through a given video lecture, there will be a pause for a quick single-question
quiz. These quizzes frequently check for knowledge that is conveyed immediately after. In other
words, you have to draw out the implications of what Ng has just taught. Some of these are hard. But
the experience of failing a quiz or guessing for a correct answer, then to see Ng&amp;#39;s walkthrough,
produces a solid learning memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graded assignments come in two forms: First, a 5-question quiz. In my experience, these can be
quite hard. Frequently they turn on drawing something out from the lecture. One extremely painful
aspect of the 5-question quizzes is that there may be a question where the rubric is to &amp;quot;pick all
answers that are correct.&amp;quot; So with five possible answers, you may have to do some hard thinking
because one of the answers may be a bit non-obvious. In Coursera, you can re-do quizzes. A couple of
times I found I had to write down the questions and then go back to the lectures to see what I had
missed. On occasion the lecture provided the underpinning for an answer, but you had to figure out
the implication yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programming assignments are top-notch. An early assignment is about recognizing hand-written
digits, and you feel this definite jaw-drop / &amp;quot;oh my god&amp;quot; when it turns out to work. I know that
this work was done years and years ago, but it is still really cool. Another example is about spam
classification. I think after going through the assignments, almost anyone will have thoughts about
problems in his or her own domain. Generally you fill in code for a missing function and then a test
harness runs the data. When you submit, your results are validated by a server at Coursera. About my
only gripe here is that there&amp;#39;s a bit of a &amp;quot;so what&amp;quot; at the end of an assignment because it doesn&amp;#39;t
really sum up what you would do with the technique when presented with a fresh problem, starting
from nothing. These programming assignments are also a treasure-trove of supporting code -- for
instance, nice plots of contours that would be useful in your own work to provide a view into your
data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programming assignments use Matlab or Octave (open source Matlab) and solutions using
vectorization are preferred (rather than writing your own for-loops to find solutions by iteration).
I found it pretty easy to find vectorized solutions but I imagine that trips up others who have been
programming for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I want to say is that there is a high cognitive bar in this course because you really
have to learn the material in three ways: First there are the equations: It&amp;#39;s not hard but of course
it&amp;#39;s its own language (Ng doesn&amp;#39;t turn the crank very much on the calculus and partial derivitives
that make a lot of it work). Then there is the linear algebra. (So, for example, there may be
something that is expressed as multiplication in the equation but you have to pick up the fact that
it is a dot product or an element-wise multiplication, based on context.) And, finally, there is the
expression of the algorithms in code (in Octave). So you are translating between three different
languages. I found this to be very difficult, and not, I think, because the last time I did linear
algebra in earnest was 40 years ago. There are some moments when you are translating between the
linear algebra and the code in Octave, and you find that you have to transpose a matrix or vector to
get it to work. I found this pretty frustrating: It didn&amp;#39;t seem to have much rhyme or reason why,
when going through a solution, you would find something in the form of a row vector rather than a
column vector, or vice versa. The TAs know this, and advise students to display the dimensions of
the variables in Octave to help with debugging, but it seems like there&amp;#39;s an impedance mismatch
between the different languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was impressed with Octave. It makes it very easy to manipulate and run operations on matrices.
There are some missing data structures, though: It would be helpful to have a proper hash or
dictionary: You can do dictionary operations with an associative array, but the syntax is obtuse.
Still, the pleasure of having matrix operations embedded in syntax is nice. No need to create
objects and run methods to do basic matrix arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum: Great course but it&amp;#39;s showing its age. I think the next course for me might be the one
on beginning TensorFlow (too bad the assignments aren&amp;#39;t in Ruby!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having completed the course, I do have some advice for learning the material and getting the
assignments finished:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Learning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Professor Ng&amp;#39;s walkthroughs of how to understand your data via visualizations is incredibly
helpful and a useful way to understand fundamental concepts like bias and variance (and how to
correct for high bias or high variance).)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Any time Professor Ng discusses tradeoffs between algorithms: pay attention -- for example,
why principal component analysis (PCA) is not linear regression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Assignments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The highest quality information comes from the videos, but pay chose attention to the errata
(&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/resources/UWXuL"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Try to solve the programming based just on the assignment PDF. But if you get stuck, consult the
tutorials. There seem to be two types of tutorials. First there are the ones that in the
Resources section, labeled, for example,
&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/resources/O756o"&gt;Progrmaming Ex. 1&lt;/a&gt;. Then
there&amp;#39;s a second page of tutorials
&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/all/threads/m0ZdvjSrEeWddiIAC9pDDA"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If you want a simplified data set, check out the
&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/all/threads/0SxufTSrEeWPACIACw4G5w"&gt;test cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure people realize what a boon the Apple Watch&amp;#39;s oximeter (blood oxygen app) may be to
one&amp;#39;s tracking of personal health, so I thought I&amp;#39;d provide some example data to provide a feel for
what you&amp;#39;ll be able to monitor. Of course, a lot will depend on what people discover about the
watch&amp;#39;s oxygen monitoring: Accuracy, the granularity of data, etc. But I think it&amp;#39;s going to be a
great help for people who want to understand better the relationship between blood oxygen levels and
heart health. Additionally, some people use oximeters to measure their oxygen out of concern for
hypoxia that is induced by the novel coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR on this is that with oximeter readings and metrics for heart rate variability, you can
get some insights into possible sleep apnea that can increase heart rate variability and potentially
cause atrial fibrillation (which can in turn provoke stroke or heart failure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All graphs and charts are shared with the permission of the person who originated the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first image shows the overnight blood oxygen this person has on a typical night using a CPAP
machine. This looks good. All SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) values are above 90%. The person&amp;#39;s
pulse is low. &lt;a href="(https://www.webmd.com/lung/pulse-oximetry-test)"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt; says: &amp;quot;A blood oxygen level
lower than 89% means you may not have enough oxygen in your blood to meet your body&amp;#39;s needs. This
could be because there’s a problem with your heart or lungs.&amp;quot; These values were collected with a
&lt;a href="https://getwellue.com/pages/o2ring-oxygen-monitor"&gt;Wellue O2Ring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../assets/images/pulseox1-6d1be445.jpg" title="Normal pulse ox readings" alt="pulseox1" width="750" height="1334" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, one way you might be starving your brain and body for oxygen is if you have sleep apnea.
This person uses a CPAP device every night, but recently when traveling did not have the CPAP.
Here&amp;#39;s what can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../assets/images/pulseox2-d625e53c.jpg" title="pulse ox readings slowing sleep apnea" alt="pulseox2" width="750" height="1334" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the second image, during sleep apnea, one&amp;#39;s blood oxygen level can spike way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prolonged episodes of sleep apnea can cause a lot of problems. The
&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;
says: &amp;quot;Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during sleep apnea increase blood pressure and
strain the cardiovascular system. Having obstructive sleep apnea increases your risk of high blood
pressure (hypertension). Obstructive sleep apnea might also increase your risk of recurrent heart
attack, stroke and abnormal heartbeats, such as atrial fibrillation. If you have heart disease,
multiple episodes of low blood oxygen (hypoxia or hypoxemia) can lead to sudden death from an
irregular heartbeat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a doctor, but there are articles
(&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306298/"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;) suggesting that prolonged sleep
apnea with its impact on blood oxygen can affect heart rate variability (HRV), which would seem to
be a leading indicator for issues such as atrial fibrillation (afib) which is a form of cardiac
arrhythmia that can lead to a stroke or heart failure. The Apple Watch can track this. Here are
three examples of HRV readings from the Apple Health app. The first one shows relatively normal HRV
for this person; the second shows elevate readings; and then the third image shows HRV leading up to
the onset of afib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this person started using a CPAP, the HRV settled down, and the heart reverted from afib to
normal &amp;quot;sinus&amp;quot; rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, had this person known his or her oxygen levels, there might have been an earlier
conversation with a physician leading to some controls (such as better diet, reduced caffiene and
alcohol consumption, more exercise, the use of a CPAP machine . . .) that might have reduced the
likelihood of afib occurring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../assets/images/hrv1-916829e7.png" title="normal heart rate variability for this person" alt="hrv1" width="742" height="830" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[I was listening to &lt;a href="https://www.bikeshed.fm/254"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; that was talking a bit about
billing, and it inspired me to go back to this post I drafted in March of 2008. It still seems about
right, so here it is. Bonus: A bit about invoicing.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The hourly rate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend (a small business owner) recently who felt that $200/hour is too much to
pay for a software or design contractor. That is indeed not a small hourly rate. But where does that
number come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how it works. Software developers and graphic designs are people just like you, with rent or
 mortgages, possibly a family, and a limited number of hours in the day to get anything done. Let&amp;#39;s
 say for the sake of argument that a young contractor wants to make on average $125,000 / year (in a
 lean year, perhaps that would be $85,000 and in a flush year it would be $150,000). This contractor
 thinks she has 2,000 billable hours per year. That&amp;#39;s really quite a lot of billable hours. It&amp;#39;s
 assuming one bills out eight hours a day, every work day, every week, except for two weeks of
 vacation. I.e., 8 hours * 5 days * 50 weeks = 2,000 total hours. Yes, the contractor might
 occasionally work 14 hours, or on weekends, but you get the idea. Personally I think overwork is a
 recipe for disaster (because overwork impinges on quality and results in billing weak hours, i.e.,
 hours made inefficient due to sleeplessness and inefficiency), and furthermore that the contractor
 should be including time off of at least four weeks off over the year, to recharge, remember one&amp;#39;s
 family, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at first it would seem that if you divided $125,000 by 2,000 hours, you&amp;#39;d get an hourly rate of
 $62.50. But that&amp;#39;s not the way it works, because the contractor is also engaging in business
 development, i.e., finding new customers. Business development can take a full 50% of one&amp;#39;s time.
 You will have to trust me on this, but it&amp;#39;s true. There is also a lot of lost business because you
 are in an existing contract and have no extra bandwidth. So it&amp;#39;s pretty unlikely that your book
 would be full. So now the hourly rate is $125/hour. The $125 basic rate also accounts for
 variability in billing: Such as: Customers who don&amp;#39;t pay; customers who make only partial payment;
 customers who get a discount for various intangible reasons. This is also why the rate goes down
 for a longer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are various forms of overhead. Independent contractors also need to pay for their own
 health care and consulting insurance; their taxes can be higher, especially if they don&amp;#39;t have a
 good accountant; and they have to pay for ongoing self-education, in the form of books,
 subscriptions, and non-billable hours in open source projects they participate in. So let us say,
 now, that a &amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot; rate is $150. They may also have to pay for an office; add $10/hour,
 at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why $200? Now we get into questions around quality. You want the best, don&amp;#39;t you? The rate is
 going to be a bell curve like everything else, with the $150/hour biller in the middle. You are
 going to be able to find people for $75/hour; and there are going to be great people who are in
 high demand who require a larger number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So have I convinced you that $200 is reasonable for great work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Invoicing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst thing we do when we build a contract is to make it expensive to stop the work. A good way
to make it expensive is to torture yourself and the contractor to define all of the work upfront
with a defined schedule, and then introduce charges for changes. Please, stop it. Define your work
in two-week sprints that deliver what is most important first. This means that the customer and
the contractor must talk about priorities and get that right. At the end of two weeks, has anything
been delivered? Yes: Continue. No: Consider stopping right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suggest sending the bill at the end of each sprint. Keep the sprint short enough (two weeks
or a week) so that if the customer doesn&amp;#39;t pay you haven&amp;#39;t lost too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, insist on payment. I made the mistake once of letting owed money mount up over
three months, and the the customer went out of business. Oops. I was out $10,000. I know others
who have experienced this. It&amp;#39;s not cool and everyone will be unhappy. So insist on prompt payment.
Be nice, but be persistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and creating invoices? Use software. When I was doing a lot of billing, I used Freckle which is
now &lt;a href="https://nokotime.com/"&gt;Noko Time&lt;/a&gt;. You track your hours, and out the other end comes a pretty
invoice, ready for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
